					The First Men arrive in Westeros via a naturally-occurring land bridge that connects the continent with Essos. Bringing their own culture and religion, they also bring along something that Westeros had never seen before: technology. Outfitted with bronze swords and boiled-leather shields, and utilizing horses for travel and combat, the First Men start to claim the land for themselves, chopping down forests to make room for their new settlements.
					<br><br>
					This displaces the original Westerosi inhabitants, a race of diminutive, magical beings that come to be called the children of the forest by the First Men; even worse, their revered weirwood trees, which they have the ability to warg into (and peer out of, thanks to the carving of faces into them), are systematically felled, which is sacrilegious to them. War follows.
					<br><br>
					The children employ their magic (including to smash the land bridge, transforming it into the Stepstone Islands), but they’re no match for the humans’ superior strength and numbers. In a last-ditch effort, they create the White Walkers to essentially act as a series of supernatural super-soldiers. However, this backfires, as the ice zombies, at some unknown point, turn against their masters, too.
					<br><br>
					A Pact is eventually signed which calls for the two peoples to coexist peacefully. The children agree to remain within the woods, while the First Men vow to leave the forests – particularly the weirwoods – alone. Eventually, they even adopt the children’s religion as their own, worshipping the gods of forest and stream and stone (a practice which remains in the north to this day).
					<br><br>
					(It’s entirely possible that the truce was necessitated by the growing threat of the White Walkers, but history doesn’t record the first massive invasion of Westeros by the undead beings until a few thousand years later. Perhaps a future episode will address this point.)

						A winter that lasts for an entire generation suddenly falls on the entire world, bringing with it the first all-out invasion of the White Walkers. Between famine, exposure, and the war itself, tens of thousands (if not more) of people perish.
						<br><br>
						In Westeros, the First Men seek out the now-forgotten dwelling places of the children of the forest, looking to forge a military alliance to keep the ice zombies at bay. It works, and the Wall – along with the Night’s Watch, to man it – is created afterwards, to ensure that a surprise attack can never befall the continent again. The children provide the first brothers of the Watch with several hundred obsidian daggers, the only weapon known to injure the Walkers.
						<br><br>
						Across the narrow sea, the Essosi rally around a legendary figure mostly known as Azor Ahai, who forges an unstoppable magical sword, Lightbringer, by tempering it in the blood – and, possibly, the soul – of his wife, Nissa Nissa. The red priests and priestesses of R’hllor, the fire god (such as Lady Melisandre [Carice van Houten]), predict that the Long Night will one day return, followed shortly by Azor himself, who will be reincarnated to save mankind anew.

						Aided by the relatively new technology of shipbuilding and navigation, a group of people called the Andals leave Essos behind and strike out for a new home in Westeros, just like the First Men did six thousand years earlier. And just like their predecessors, the Andals begin a violent colonization process, starting a long-lasting war with the First Men as they push their way up north.
						<br><br>
						Once again, a truce is eventually signed, resulting in the harmonious cohabitation of the land. The First Men remain in the north, where they continue to pray to the Old Gods, while the newcomers take all the rest of the continent, establishing their new Faith of the Seven (of which the High Sparrow [Jonathan Pryce] was the most recent leader). The Andals’ cultural invention of knights and chivalry, however, will eventually become practiced all throughout the land.
						<br><br>
						Another side-effect of the migration is far less positive, however: the complete disappearance of the children of the forest in the face of the greater human presence. Soon, the humans believe them to be extinct, and (in time) just a myth.

					Originally just one of countless societies scattered all across the large landmass that is Essos, Valyria left its provincial, sheep-herding ways behind when it discovered the presence of dragons within its borders (nesting in a massive ring of volcanoes). Once the Valyrians learn how to employ magic to domesticate the massive beasts, they quickly establish themselves as the greatest political and military power that the world has ever known, reigning for some five millennia.
					<br><br>
					The previous Essosi superpower, the Old Empire of Ghis, attempts to stave off its extinction by going to war some five times with the Valyrians, but its legions of lockstep soldiers (most likely slaves, like their present-day Unsullied successors) were no match for dragons. The Valyrian Freehold swells to include the former Ghiscari territory, including Slaver’s Bay (where Daenerys Targaryen [Emilia Clarke] currently calls home), and even extends all the way westward to the very edge of Westeros itself, forming the remote outpost of Dragonstone (which would eventually be controlled by King Stannis Baratheon [Stephan Dillane]).

					The third and final major migration into Westeros is instigated by the Valyrians, who attempt to continue to push their imperial holdings all across Essos. The Rhoynar, an egalitarian people who had settled all along the mighty Rhoyne River, are soundly defeated in war (water magic is, apparently, useless in the face of dragons), prompting their warrior-queen, Nymeria (the figure for whom Arya Stark [Maisie Williams] names her pet direwolf), to set sail for a new home. They ultimately find Dorne, where Nymeria marries into House Martell and promulgates her people’s socially liberal culture – explaining why Dorne remains so unique amongst all the other kingdoms of Westeros (including their usage of “prince” for their monarchs instead of “king”).

					After five millennia of unbroken dominance, the Valyrian Freehold abruptly falls when a disaster of unknown nature strikes Valyria, turning the peninsula into a series of islands. (It seems doubtless that the huge chain of volcanoes running through the country is responsible for the cataclysm, but we’re unsure whether their massive and unprecedented eruptions were either magical or strictly geological in nature.) The now-flooded area has been called the Smoking Sea ever since.
					<br><br>
					There are two powerful effects of the so-called Doom of Valyria: firstly, all Valyrian spells, knowledge, and recorded history are forever lost; secondly – and more profoundly – the rest of the dragonriders’ empire almost instantly crumbles along with its homeland, leaving many regions and former colonies to declare their independence (including Slaver’s Bay and the Nine Free Cities).

					Just 12 years before the Doom of Valyria, Daenys Targaryen had a prophetic vision (a family trait that would continue on down through the centuries) of the apocalyptic fall of the Freehold. She begs her father to move House Targaryen to the remote safety of Dragonstone, which he does, saving his family and allowing them to become the sole remaining standard-bearer of the former empire.
					<br><br>
					In the century after the Valyrians’ fall, the Targaryens attempt to expand their holdings, to recreate their own little slice of the Freehold. However, it isn’t until the arrival of Aegon that their dreams of conquest are realized. At first intervening in the near-constant warring between the Free Cities, Aegon quickly chooses to turn his back entirely on Essos and do something which had never been done before: unite all of Westeros into one giant, overarching kingdom. (By this point in time, the several hundred kingdoms that the First Men had originally founded had been whittled down to just seven, thanks to neighbors assimilating one another through military conquest or marriage alliances.)
					<br><br>
					Aegon’s Conquest sees him, his two sister-wives (Visenya and Rhaenys), and their three dragons (Balerion, Vhagar, and Meraxes, respectively), supported by a comparatively small number of soldiers, overpower six of the seven kingdoms, with some of the competing kings being slain in battle and others voluntarily submitting to King Aegon I Targaryen. After just two short years, the seven kingdoms of Westeros become the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. The after-effects are profound: the Iron Throne is assembled out of the melted-down swords of all of Aegon’s fallen foes; King’s Landing, the new capital city, is constructed on the spot of his initial landing and the beginning of his campaign; and the former kings are given new titles, such as the Starks, who used to reign as the Kings in the North but are now called the Wardens of the North.
					<br><br>
					Although Dorne technically still remains independent of the new Targaryen rule – it’s the only kingdom to successfully withstand the might of the dragonriders – it will, 187 years later, be brought into the monarchical fold through a marriage arrangement that would see the then-current prince of Dorne marry a Targaryen princess.
